        <h2>Hello I'm Vincent</h2>
        <p>and I'm aspiring to become a software developer. I'm passionate about technology and programming and I aim to create software that meets the needs of users. Although I’m still learning the ropes of software development, I am currently building a webpage to promote SDG 14, Life Below Water. Through this project, I’m gaining hands-on experience in web design and coding while exploring how technology can be used to support environmental advocacy. </p>
        <p>I chose SDG 14 because I believe in the importance of raising awareness about the life beneath the ocean's surface. Oceans cover most of the Earth, and their health is vital for the planet’s sustainability. However, they face numerous threats such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which endanger marine life and disrupt ecosystems. By promoting SDG 14, I hope to inspire action towards protecting marine biodiversity and ensuring the future of our oceans.</p>
